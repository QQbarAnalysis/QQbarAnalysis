# TTbarAnalysis

The whole steps of processors for TTbar analysis is shown in this directory.
The main target of this analysis is to process l5 ttbar pair production events with semi-leptonic channel @ 500 GeV.

## Processors

* [Particle Tagger](https://github.com/QQbarAnalysis/ParticleTagger) - Kaon identification
* [Truth Vertex Finder](https://github.com/yuichiok/VertexMCTest) - Access generated vertex information
* [Trash Reco Processor](https://github.com/yuichiok/VertexRecoTest) - Access reconstructed vertex information
* [Vertex Restorer](https://github.com/yuichiok/VertexRestorer) - Vertex recovery
