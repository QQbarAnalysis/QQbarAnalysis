IMPORTANT COMMENTS *******************

Please make sure that you add the following lines

  <parameter name="DBDanalysis" type="bool"> true </parameter>
  <parameter name="KaonCheat" type="bool"> true </parameter>

In these scripts the lines are not included because it was implemented directly in the libraries, but the QQBarProcessor has been modified to be more generic (for IDR).

The data and lcfiweight fodlers are expected to be inside each folder (i.e. via symbolic links)
